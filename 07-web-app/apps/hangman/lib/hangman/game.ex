defmodule Hangman.Game do

  @moduledoc """

  This is the backend for a Hangman game. It manages the game state.
  Clients make moves, and this code validates them and reports back
  the updated state.

  Our API is

  * `game = Hangman.Game.new_game`
  * `{game, status, guess} = make_move(game, guess)`

  and the auxiliary functions

  * `status = get_status(game)`
  * `{game, status} = reset_game(game)`


## Example of use

Here's this module being exercised from an iex session. For all but
the first line we only show the resulting status (not the value of the
`game` variable).

    Set up the state for a new game, and return that state. The client
    applications will pass this state back to your code in all the
    subsequent API calls.

        `{ game, status } = Hangman.Game.new_game()`

    The `game` that's returned is an opaque structure. The `status` is
    the public status of this game (see `make_move`).

    As an aid to testing, there's a second form of this function:

        `{ game, status } = Hangman.Game.new_game(word)`

    This forces `word` to be this game's hidden word.
